Red Shell
====

Run task/select to select a shell.  Selection criteria is from [Redo](https://redo.rtfd.io/).  Executable red-sh runs that shell with:

* -C: prevent existing file overwrite with '>' (use '>|' instead)
* -u: error on unknown variables
* -e: error on untested command failure


Install
----

Move or copy this entire directory to /opt/red-sh or another directory.  Run task/finalize.  Copy sh to /bin/red-sh.  Use /bin/red-sh as an absolute path for "#!" lines.

    cd /opt
    git clone https://github.com/rdpate/red-sh.git
    red-sh/task/select
    red-sh/task/finalize
    cp red-sh/red-sh /bin/red-sh

(If task/finalize is not used, symlinks to red-sh will work, but copies will not.)
